I used a free online to program an experiment for a Behavioral Research Methods course I taught.


-----------------

My students and I needed a way to measure reaction time to stimuli as part of an idea we had for our level -300 Behavioral Methods course. I didn't have access to programs I had used for human behavior experiments as a grad student (ePrime, Superlab, and way way in the past psi). I found this website psytoolkit.org and we got up and running! I did not have time for the learning curve associated with other ways of displaying stimuli and capturing RT, so this was perfect. Here's an example of part of my code!
